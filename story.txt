s is my story about potatoes. There once was a potato that watned to be a
big potato. He was the smallest potato and got picked on by older and bigger
potatoes. So this potato started to soak up a lot of sunlight and drank lots
of water so he would grow.
Greg: Additionally, the potato began to lift heavy objects and took large doses of creatine supplements, further increasing his mass. The other potatoes noticed
his progress and no longer bullied him, but instead asked for tips on how to get
as bulky as him.
